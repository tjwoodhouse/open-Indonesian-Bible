<h6>Introduction</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah and during the reign of King Jeroboam, son of Joash of Israel. 
<h6>The adultery of Hosea’s wife</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v028001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 When the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  began to speak through Hosea, he said to him: 
<p class="indent1">  “Go marry an unfaithful woman 
<p class="indent1">  who will bear you children by her adultery, 
<p class="indent1">  for like an adulterous wife the land is unfaithful to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” 
<!-- 001 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v028001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 So he married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam, and when she conceived and bore him a son, <span class="verse" rel="v028001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said: 
<p class="indent1">  “Call him ‘Jezreel,’ for in a little while 
<p class="indent1">  I will punish the dynasty of Jehu 
<p class="indent1">  for the blood shed at the valley of Jezreel, 
<p class="indent1">  I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 On that day, I will break Israel’s bows and arrows 
<p class="indent1">  in the valley of Jezreel.” 
<!-- 001 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v028001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 When she conceived again and bore a daughter, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Hosea: 
<p class="indent1">  “Call her Lo-Ruhamah – ‘No-Compassion’ 
<p class="indent1">  for I will no longer have compassion on Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  certainly not spare them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 But on Judah I will have compassion, 
<p class="indent1">  I will deliver them by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God, 
<p class="indent1">  but I will not deliver them by bow nor by sword, 
<p class="indent1">  nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.” 
<!-- 001 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v028001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 After she had weaned No-Compassion, and when she conceived and bore a son, he said: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 “Call him Lo-Ammi – ‘Not-My-People’ 
<p class="indent1">  for you, Israel, are not my people, 
<p class="indent1">  and I indeed am not your God.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Yet the number of the Israelites 
<p class="indent1">  will be as the sand of the sea, 
<p class="indent1">  which cannot be measured or counted, 
<p class="indent1">  and where they were told, “You are not my people,” 
<p class="indent1">  they will be called, “children of the living God.” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 The Judeans and the Israelites 
<p class="indent1">  will join together again, 
<p class="indent1">  will appoint for themselves one leader, 
<p class="indent1">  will return to their own land. 
<p class="indent1">  Great will be the day of Jezreel! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> So call your brothers, My People, 
<p class="indent1">  and your sisters, Compassion. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Accuse, accuse your mother: 
<p class="indent1">  for she is not my wife, 
<p class="indent1">  and I will not be her husband. 
<p class="indent1">  Let her put her acts of infidelity out of her sight, 
<p class="indent1">  and her lovers from between her breasts, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 else I will strip her bare, 
<p class="indent1">  expose her as she was on the day of her birth, 
<p class="indent1">  make her like the wilderness, 
<p class="indent1">  let her become like a parched land, 
<p class="indent1">  and let her die of thirst. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 And on her children I will have no pity, 
<p class="indent1">  since they are children of adultery, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 for their mother has become a prostitute, 
<p class="indent1">  she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. <p>
<p class="indent1">  She has said, 
<p class="indent1">  “I will go after my lovers 
<p class="indent1">  who gave me my bread and my water, 
<p class="indent1">  my wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink.” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 That is why I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns, 
<p class="indent1">  and build a wall about her, 
<p class="indent1">  so that she cannot find her paths. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 She will pursue her lovers, 
<p class="indent1">  but will not overtake them. 
<p class="indent1">  She will seek them, 
<p class="indent1">  but not find them. 
<p class="indent1">  In time she will say, 
<p class="indent1">  “I will go back to my first husband, 
<p class="indent1">  I was better off then than now.” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 She herself did not know 
<p class="indent1">  that it was I who gave her 
<p class="indent1">  the grain, the sweet wine, and the oil, 
<p class="indent1">  who lavished on her silver and gold – 
<p class="indent1">  that they used in worshipping Baal! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002009" id="002009" >9</span>
  So I will take back my grain at the harvest, 
<p class="indent1">  and my sweet wine in its season. 
<p class="indent1">  I will withdraw my wool and my flax, 
<p class="indent1">  given to cover her nakedness; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 and so I will strip her naked before her lovers, 
<p class="indent1">  and no one shall deliver her out of my hand. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 I will end all her celebrations, 
<p class="indent1">  her yearly feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, 
<p class="indent1">  all her festivals. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, 
<p class="indent1">  of which she says, “These are my wages 
<p class="indent1">  which my lovers have given me.” 
<p class="indent1">  I will make them a thicket, 
<p class="indent1">  and the wild animals will eat them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 In this way I will punish her for the days of the Baals, 
<p class="indent1">  in which she made offerings to them, 
<p class="indent1">  and decked herself with earrings and jewels, 
<p class="indent1">  and went after her lovers, 
<p class="indent1">  but forgot me, 
<p class="indent1">  – declares the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 So I am going to court her, 
<p class="indent1">  bring her into the wilderness, 
<p class="indent1">  and speak tenderly to her. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 I will give her from there her vineyards, 
<p class="indent1">  and the valley of Achor as a door of hope. 
<p class="indent1">  There she will respond as in the days of her youth, 
<p class="indent1">  as in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 At that time, declares the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  you will call me your husband, 
<p class="indent1">  and will no more call me your master. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 I will remove the name of the Baals from her mouth, 
<p class="indent1">  their names never again uttered. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 On that day I will make for them a covenant 
<p class="indent1">  with the wild animals, 
<p class="indent1">  the birds of the sky, 
<p class="indent1">  and the creatures that crawl on the earth. 
<p class="indent1">  I will break the bow and the sword, 
<p class="indent1">  banish battle from the land, 
<p class="indent1">  and I will make them lie down in safety. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 I will take you for my wife forever, 
<p class="indent1">  I will take you for my wife in righteousness, 
<p class="indent1">  in justice, in kindness, and in mercy. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 I will take you for my wife in faithfulness, 
<p class="indent1">  and you will know the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 On that day I will answer 
<p class="indent1">  – declares the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  I will answer the empty skies, 
<p class="indent1">  and they will answer the dry earth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 The earth will answer with grain, 
<p class="indent1">  and new wine and oil, 
<p class="indent1">  and they will answer Jezreel, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 and I will plant her in the land. 
<p class="indent1">  I will have compassion to No-Compassion, 
<p class="indent1">  I will say to Not-My-People, “You are my people,” 
<p class="indent1">  and they will say, “You are my God.” 
<!-- 003 023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me, “Go again, show love to this woman, who is loved by another, who commits adultery. Love her as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods, and love the raisin cakes offered to idols. 
<!-- 003 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v028003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 So I redeemed her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley. <span class="verse" rel="v028003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 And I told her, “You must live with me for many days and you must not sleep around or marry another. And I will do the same for you. 
<!-- 003 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v028003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 And like this the Israelites will live for a long time without king and without prince, without sacrifice and without pillar, without ephod and without teraphim. <span class="verse" rel="v028003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Yet afterward the Israelites will return, and seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God and their Davidic king, and in the days to come they will turn with awe to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and his goodness. 
<h6>The Lord’s case against Israel</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Hear the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message, Israelites, 
<p class="indent1">  for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has brought charges against the inhabitants of the land, 
<p class="indent1">  for there is no fidelity, nor true love, 
<p class="indent1">  nor knowledge of God in the land, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 but cursing, lying, and murder, 
<p class="indent1">  stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence, 
<p class="indent1">  and acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 Therefore the land mourns, 
<p class="indent1">  all its inhabitants languish, 
<p class="indent1">  the wild animals and the birds of the skies, 
<p class="indent1">  even the fish of the sea are dying. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Yet let no one bring charges, 
<p class="indent1">  let none accuse, 
<p class="indent1">  for your people are like those, 
<p class="indent1">  who bring charges against a priest <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. </span> . 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 You stumble by day, 
<p class="indent1">  and the prophet stumbles with you by night, 
<p class="indent1">  and I will destroy your mother. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 My people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge; 
<p class="indent1">  because you have rejected knowledge 
<p class="indent1">  I reject you from being priest to me. 
<p class="indent1">  Since you have forgotten the teaching of your God, 
<p class="indent1">  I also will forget your children. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 The more priests there are, the more they sin against me. 
<p class="indent1">  I will change their dignity to dishonor. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 They feed on the sin offerings of my people, 
<p class="indent1">  so they hunger after their guilt. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest: 
<p class="indent1">  I will visit upon each punishment for their ways, 
<p class="indent1">  and their deeds I will repay them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 They will eat and not be satisfied, 
<p class="indent1">  they will sleep around but stay childless, 
<p class="indent1">  because they have abandoned the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<p class="indent1">  to give themselves to <span class="verse" rel="v028004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 prostitution. <p>
<p class="indent1">  Old and new wine take away the understanding. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 My own people ask counsel of a piece of wood! 
<p class="indent1">  A stick gives them advice! 
<p class="indent1">  For a spirit of prostitution has led them astray, 
<p class="indent1">  they commit adultery against their God. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice, 
<p class="indent1">  and on the hills they burn incense 
<p class="indent1">  under oaks and poplars and terebinths, 
<p class="indent1">  for their shade is so pleasant. 
<p class="indent1">  Therefore your daughters become cult prostitutes, 
<p class="indent1">  and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 I will not punish your daughters for committing prostitution, 
<p class="indent1">  nor your daughters-in-law for adultery. 
<p class="indent1">  Your men visit prostitutes, 
<p class="indent1">  sacrifice with cult prostitutes. 
<p class="indent1">  So a people without understanding come to ruin! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Though you commit adultery, Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  let not Judah become guilty. 
<p class="indent1">  Do not go to Gilgal, 
<p class="indent1">  do not go up to Beth-aven, 
<p class="indent1">  nor swear an oath, “As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 Like a willful heifer, 
<p class="indent1">  Israel is stubborn. 
<p class="indent1">  Can the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  now feed them 
<p class="indent1">  as he would a lamb in a broad pasture? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004017" id="004017" >17</span>
  Ephraim is wedded to idols. 
<p class="indent1">  Leave them alone! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 When their drinking is over

<h6>The guilt of priests and princes</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Hear this, priests! 
<p class="indent1">  Attend, Israelites! 
<p class="indent1">  Listen, royal family! 
<p class="indent1">  For you is the judgment: 
<p class="indent1">  a snare you have become at Mizpeh, 
<p class="indent1">  and a net spread out on Tabor, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 the rebels are deep in slaughter, 
<p class="indent1">  but I will discipline all. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005003" id="005003" >3</span>
  I know Ephraim, 
<p class="indent1">  Israel is not hidden from me, 
<p class="indent1">  for you, Ephraim, have committed prostitution 
<p class="indent1">  and Israel is defiled. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 Their deeds do not permit them 
<p class="indent1">  to return to their God. 
<p class="indent1">  For the spirit of prostitution is within them, 
<p class="indent1">  they do not know the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, 
<p class="indent1">  Israel, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin, 
<p class="indent1">  and Judah also stumbles with them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 With their sheep and their cattle 
<p class="indent1">  they will go to seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<p class="indent1">  but they will not find him, 
<p class="indent1">  he has withdrawn from them, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 for they have been untrue to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  their children are strangers. 
<p class="indent1">  Their new moon festivals will soon destroy them and their fields. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Blow the trumpet in Gibeah, 
<p class="indent1">  the clarion in Ramah!

 Ephraim will become a desolation 
<p class="indent1">  in the day of punishment, 
<p class="indent1">  concerning the tribes of Israel

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 The princes of Israel have become 
<p class="indent1">  like thieves who move boundary stones. 
<p class="indent1">  On them I will pour out my wrath like a flood. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed by judgment, 
<p class="indent1">  for they are determined to go after vanity <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       So LXX. Heb. uncertain.  </span> . <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 So I am like a moth to Ephraim, 
<p class="indent1">  like rottenness to the house of Judah. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 For when Ephraim saw their sickness 
<p class="indent1">  and Israel their wound, 
<p class="indent1">  Ephraim turned to Assyria, 
<p class="indent1">  to its patron king. 
<p class="indent1">  But he cannot heal you 
<p class="indent1">  nor relieve you of your wound. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 For I myself will be like a lion to Ephraim, 
<p class="indent1">  like a young lion to the house of Judah. 
<p class="indent1">  I, yes I, will rend and go my way, 
<p class="indent1">  I will carry off and none will rescue. 
<h6>The lack of repentance and reform</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 I will return to my place, 
<p class="indent1">  until in remorse they seek my presence. 
<p class="indent1">  When they are in distress they will quickly seek me, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> saying, “Come let us return to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  for he has torn us

 Let us know, let us eagerly seek to know the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1">  His coming is as sure as the sunrise. 
<p class="indent1">  He will come to us like the winter rain,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 What can I make of you, Ephraim! 
<p class="indent1">  What can I make of you, Judah! 
<p class="indent1">  Your love is like a morning cloud, 
<p class="indent1">  like the dew which early goes away. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 That is why I have hewn them by the prophets, 
<p class="indent1">  I have slain them by the words of my mouth. 
<p class="indent1">  My judgment is like the light that goes forth, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 for it is love that I delight in and not sacrifice, 
<p class="indent1">  and knowledge of God and not burnt offerings. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 But they after the manner of men have transgressed the covenant, 
<p class="indent1">  there they have played me false. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Gilead is a city of evildoers, 
<p class="indent1">  tracked with bloody footprints, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006009" id="006009" >9</span>

<p class="indent1">  How terrible is the evil they do! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 In Bethel I have seen a horrible thing. 
<p class="indent1">  There Ephraim plays the prostitute, 
<p class="indent1">  Israel is defiled. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 Judah for you also a harvest is set. <p>
<p class="indent1">  When I would restore the fortunes of my people, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> when I would heal Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  then Ephrain’s guilt is revealed,

<p class="indent1">  while outside bandits plunder. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 But it never crosses their minds 
<p class="indent1">  that I remember their wickedness. 
<p class="indent1">  Now their misdeeds surround them, 
<p class="indent1">  they are always before my face. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 Their wickedness amuses the king, 
<p class="indent1">  and their lying gladdens the princes, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 since they are all of them adulterers. 
<p class="indent1">  Their desire to do evil 
<p class="indent1">  burns like an oven heated by the baker, 
<p class="indent1">  so hot that he need not stir the fire, 
<p class="indent1">  from the kneading of the dough, until it rises. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 On our king’s festival day,

 for like an oven their heart burns with treachery,

<p class="indent1">  in the morning it blazes into a flame of fire. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 All of them glow like an oven,

<h6>Evidence of the nation’s iniquity</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 Ephraim – he lets himself be mixed among the peoples, 
<p class="indent1">  Ephraim – he has become a cake unturned. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 Strangers have devoured his strength, but he does not know it. 
<p class="indent1">  His hair is sprinkled with grey, but he does not notice. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 Israel’s arrogance testifies against them 
<p class="indent1">  yet they do not return to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God, 
<p class="indent1">  and in all this they do not seek him. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 Ephraim is like a simple, silly dove: 
<p class="indent1">  to Egypt they call, after Assyria they go, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 wherever they turn I will spread my net over them, 
<p class="indent1">  like birds of the sky I will bring them down, 
<p class="indent1">  I will catch them when I hear them gathering. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! 
<p class="indent1">  Destruction to them, for they have been untrue to me. <p>
<p class="indent1">  Although it was I who redeemed them, 
<p class="indent1">  they speak lies about me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 They have never cried to me with their hearts, 
<p class="indent1">  but they are always wailing on their beds. 
<p class="indent1">  They gather to beg for corn and new wine, 
<p class="indent1">  but they turn away from me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 Although it was I who trained and strengthened their arms, 
<p class="indent1">  concerning me they plan only evil. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 They turn away from the Most High <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. </span> . 
<p class="indent1">  They have become like a bow that swerves. 
<p class="indent1">  Their princes will fall by the sword, 
<p class="indent1">  because of the insolence of their tongues. 
<p class="indent1">  The land of Egypt will mock them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> Put the horn to your mouth!

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 But Israel has spurned that which is good, 
<p class="indent1">  so let the foe pursue him. 
<h6>The Lord’s rejection of Israel’s rulers and idols</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 They themselves have made kings 
<p class="indent1">  but without my consent. 
<p class="indent1">  They have made princes 
<p class="indent1">  but without my knowledge. 
<p class="indent1">  Out of their silver and gold, 
<p class="indent1">  they have made idols to their destruction! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 Your calf idol, O Samaria, is distasteful. 
<p class="indent1">  My anger is kindled against them. 
<p class="indent1">  How long will they escape punishment? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 Israel made the thing: 
<p class="indent1">  a workman made it. 
<p class="indent1">  It is not a god! 
<p class="indent1">  Samaria’s calf will become mere splinters. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 They sow the wind and will reap the whirlwind. 
<p class="indent1">  A shoot which has no stalk, yields no fruit 
<p class="indent1">  If it should yield, strangers would devour it. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 Israel is devoured. 
<p class="indent1">  Already it lies discarded among the nations 
<p class="indent1">  like a worthless pot. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 For by themselves they have gone up to Assyria 
<p class="indent1">  like a wild donkey which wanders by itself. 
<p class="indent1">  Ephraim pays for love 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 but even if they sell themselves among the nations, 
<p class="indent1">  I will round them up. 
<p class="indent1">  Soon the kings and princes will writhe under the burden of tribute! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 For as many altars as Ephraim has erected, 
<p class="indent1">  they are to him altars for sinning, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 were I to write for him ever so many instructions, 
<p class="indent1">  they would be regarded as from a stranger. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 The people love sacrifice, and so they offer sacrifices, 
<p class="indent1">  meat, and so they eat it, 
<p class="indent1">  although the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is not pleased with them, 
<p class="indent1">  so now he will remember their guilt, 
<p class="indent1">  and punish their sins. 
<p class="indent1">  Back to Egypt with them! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 For Israel forgot his Maker and built palaces, 
<p class="indent1">  and Judah multiplied fortified cities. 
<p class="indent1">  But I will send fire upon her cities, 
<p class="indent1">  and it will devour her strongholds. 
<h6>The horrors of the coming exile</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> Rejoice not too loudly, Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  like the nations,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 Threshing floor and wine vat won’t feed them, 
<p class="indent1">  the new wine will fail them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 They will not stay in the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s land, 
<p class="indent1">  but Ephraim will return to Egypt, 
<p class="indent1">  and in Assyria they will eat what is unclean. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 They will not pour out libations of wine to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  nor please him with their sacrifices. 
<p class="indent1">  Their bread will be like the bread of mourners: 
<p class="indent1">  all who eat it will defile themselves. 
<p class="indent1">  For their bread will be only for their hunger, 
<p class="indent1">  it will not come into the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s temple. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 What will you do on the day of the festival?

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 Even if they flee from destruction, 
<p class="indent1">  Egypt will gather them, 
<p class="indent1">  Memphis will bury them. 
<p class="indent1">  Nettles will take possession of their treasure of silver, 
<p class="indent1">  thorns will push into their tents. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 The days of punishment are come, 
<p class="indent1">  the days of recompense are at hand, 
<p class="indent1">  as soon the Israelites will know! 
<p class="indent1">  “The prophet is a fool,

<p class="indent1">  It is because of the greatness of your iniquity 
<p class="indent1">  and the greatness of your hatred. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 Ephraim acts the spy with my God, 
<p class="indent1">  a prophet finds the snares of a fowler are in all his ways. 
<p class="indent1">  In the house of his God they lay hostile plots, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 they commit crimes as in the days of Gibeah, 
<p class="indent1">  God will remember their iniquity.

 I found Israel 
<p class="indent1">  like finding grapes in the wilderness. 
<p class="indent1">  I saw your ancestors 
<p class="indent1">  like they were the first fruit on a fig tree, 
<p class="indent1">  but as soon as they came to Baal-peor, 
<p class="indent1">  they consecrated themselves to shamefulness,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 Ephraim – like a bird his glory flies away. 
<p class="indent1">  There will be no more birth,

<p class="indent1">  no more conception. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 Even though they bring up their children,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009013" id="009013" >13</span>

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 All their evil began in Gilgal,

 Ephraim is blighted,

 The inhabitants of Samaria will tremble with fear

 From the time of Gibeah, Israel has sinned. 
<p class="indent1">  There they took their stand. 
<p class="indent1">  Will not war overtake them in Gibeah 
<p class="indent1">  because of the wicked? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 When I please, I will punish them.

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 Ephraim indeed was a trained heifer that loved to thresh grain, 
<p class="indent1">  and I myself laid a yoke upon his fair neck <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. </span> , 
<p class="indent1">  I made Ephraim draw and Judah must plow, 
<p class="indent1">  Jacob must turn the soil for himself. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 Sow for yourselves righteousness,

<p class="indent1">  Break up your fallow ground,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 But you have plowed wickedness, 
<p class="indent1">  iniquity have you reaped. 
<p class="indent1">  You have eaten the fruit of lies. <p>
<p class="indent1">  Because you have trusted in your own path <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       LXX: chariots </span> ,

<h6>The Lord’s love for his faithless people</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> When Israel was young, then I began to love him, 
<p class="indent1">  and out of Egypt I called my son. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 The more I called them, 
<p class="indent1">  the further they went away from me. 
<p class="indent1">  They kept sacrificing to Baals 
<p class="indent1">  and making offerings to idols. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, 
<p class="indent1">  taking them up in my arms, 
<p class="indent1">  but they did not know that I healed them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 With humane cords I ever drew them, 
<p class="indent1">  with bands of love. 
<p class="indent1">  I was to them as one who lifts up the yoke from off their jaws, 
<p class="indent1">  and bending toward them, I gave them food to eat. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 No! They return to the land of Egypt, 
<p class="indent1">  Assyria will be their king, 
<p class="indent1">  for they have refused to return to me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 Therefore the swords will whirl in their cities,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011007" id="011007" >7</span>

<p class="indent1">  even if they call on the Most High he will not raise them <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. </span> . <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 How can I give you up, Ephraim! 
<p class="indent1">  Give you over, Israel! 
<p class="indent1">  How am I to give you up as Admah! 
<p class="indent1">  Make you like Zeboim! 
<p class="indent1">  My heart asserts itself, 
<p class="indent1">  my sympathies are all aglow. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 I will not carry into effect the fierceness of my anger,

<p class="indent1">  for God am I, and not man,

<h6>Israel’s faithlessness from the first</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 Ephraim has encompassed me with falsehood, 
<p class="indent1">  and the house of Israel with deceit. 
<p class="indent1">  But Judah still wanders with God 
<p class="indent1">  faithful to the Holy One <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. Or "Judah is still restless against God" </span> . 
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> Ephraim herds the wind and hunts the sirocco. 
<p class="indent1">  All day long they heap up falsehood and fraud, 
<p class="indent1">  make a treaty with Assyria, 
<p class="indent1">  and sends tribute of olive oil to Egypt. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has a charge to bring against Israel,

<p class="indent1">  according to his deeds will he requite him, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028012003" id="012003" >3</span>
 In the womb he supplanted his brother, 
<p class="indent1">  in manhood he wrestled with God, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028012004" id="012004" >4</span>
 He wrestled with the angel and prevailed,

<p class="indent1">  At Bethel the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  found him, 
<p class="indent1">  and there he spoke with us. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028012005" id="012005" >5</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is the God of hosts,

 So now, by the help of your God, return.

 Ephraim says, “Yes, I have become rich,

 I spoke continually by the prophets.

 In Gilead is iniquity,

 Ephraim has given bitter provocation. 
<p class="indent1">  His Lord will leave upon him his guilt of bloodshed,

<h6>The Lord’s final destruction of the guilty nation</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> When Ephraim used to speak there was trembling;

 And now they go on sinning. 
<p class="indent1">  They make for themselves molten gods –

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 Therefore they shall be like the morning mist,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 Yet it was I, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028013006" id="013006" >6</span>
 When they were pastured

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v028013008" id="013008" >8</span>
 I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs,
