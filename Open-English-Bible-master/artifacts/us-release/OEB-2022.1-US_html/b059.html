<h2>The Letter from</h2>
<h1>James</h1>
<h6>Greeting</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">J</span>ames, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes that are living abroad. 
<h6>Advice on Various Subjects</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing, <span class="verse" rel="v059001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance. <span class="verse" rel="v059001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking. 
<!-- 001 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them. <span class="verse" rel="v059001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind – <span class="verse" rel="v059001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord, <span class="verse" rel="v059001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn. 
<!-- 001 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position, <span class="verse" rel="v059001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower. <span class="verse" rel="v059001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away. 
<!-- 001 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him. <span class="verse" rel="v059001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone. <span class="verse" rel="v059001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them. <span class="verse" rel="v059001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death. <span class="verse" rel="v059001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Do not be deceived, my dear friends. <span class="verse" rel="v059001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse. <span class="verse" rel="v059001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation. <p>
<!-- 001 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry; <span class="verse" rel="v059001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God. <span class="verse" rel="v059001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls. <span class="verse" rel="v059001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves. <span class="verse" rel="v059001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror. <span class="verse" rel="v059001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 They look at themselves, then go on their way, <span class="verse" rel="v059001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do. <span class="verse" rel="v059001026" id="001026" >26</span>
 When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless. <span class="verse" rel="v059001027" id="001027" >27</span>
 That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world. 
<h6>Warning on Various Subjects</h6>
<!-- 002 027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination? <span class="verse" rel="v059002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes, <span class="verse" rel="v059002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man – “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,” <span class="verse" rel="v059002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement? <span class="verse" rel="v059002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him? <span class="verse" rel="v059002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts? <span class="verse" rel="v059002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Isn’t it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism? <span class="verse" rel="v059002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 If you keep the royal law which runs – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right; <span class="verse" rel="v059002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it. <span class="verse" rel="v059002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions. <span class="verse" rel="v059002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law. <span class="verse" rel="v059002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’ <span class="verse" rel="v059002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice. 
<!-- 002 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them? <span class="verse" rel="v059002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread, <span class="verse" rel="v059002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 and one of you says to them – “Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!” and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them? <span class="verse" rel="v059002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing. <span class="verse" rel="v059002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Someone, indeed, may say – “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.” 
<!-- 002 018 -->


<p>  “Then show me your faith,” I reply, “apart from any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.” <span class="verse" rel="v059002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought. <span class="verse" rel="v059002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing? <span class="verse" rel="v059002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar? <span class="verse" rel="v059002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions; <span class="verse" rel="v059002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 and that in this way the words of scripture came true – “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.” <span class="verse" rel="v059002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone. <span class="verse" rel="v059002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road? <span class="verse" rel="v059002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions. 
<!-- 003 026 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others. <span class="verse" rel="v059003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well. <span class="verse" rel="v059003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies. <span class="verse" rel="v059003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine. <span class="verse" rel="v059003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze! <span class="verse" rel="v059003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna. <span class="verse" rel="v059003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans, <span class="verse" rel="v059003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison! <span class="verse" rel="v059003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’ <span class="verse" rel="v059003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so. <span class="verse" rel="v059003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source? <span class="verse" rel="v059003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water. 
<!-- 003 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom. <span class="verse" rel="v059003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth. <span class="verse" rel="v059003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic. <span class="verse" rel="v059003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions. <span class="verse" rel="v059003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity. <span class="verse" rel="v059003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace. <p>
<!-- 004 018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you? <span class="verse" rel="v059004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask. <span class="verse" rel="v059004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures. <span class="verse" rel="v059004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God. <span class="verse" rel="v059004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, ‘Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?’ <span class="verse" rel="v059004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, – 
<p class="indent1">  ‘God opposes the haughty, 
<p class="indent2">  but gives grace to the humble.’ <p>
<!-- 004 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you. <span class="verse" rel="v059004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators! <span class="verse" rel="v059004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom! <span class="verse" rel="v059004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you. <span class="verse" rel="v059004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it. <span class="verse" rel="v059004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbor? <p>
<!-- 004 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v059004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,’ <span class="verse" rel="v059004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes. <span class="verse" rel="v059004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Instead you should say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’ <span class="verse" rel="v059004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked. <span class="verse" rel="v059004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them. 
<!-- 005 017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you! <span class="verse" rel="v059005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten. <span class="verse" rel="v059005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days. <span class="verse" rel="v059005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 Listen! The wages you have held back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts! <span class="verse" rel="v059005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed. <span class="verse" rel="v059005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?

 Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains. <span class="verse" rel="v059005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near. <span class="verse" rel="v059005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door! <span class="verse" rel="v059005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. <span class="verse" rel="v059005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’

 Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.

 If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns. <span class="verse" rel="v059005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. <span class="verse" rel="v059005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven. <span class="verse" rel="v059005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer. <span class="verse" rel="v059005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years. <span class="verse" rel="v059005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops. <span class="verse" rel="v059005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again, <span class="verse" rel="v059005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.
