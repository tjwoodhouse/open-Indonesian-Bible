<h1>John’s First Letter</h1>
<h6>Preface</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">W</span>e write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands. <span class="verse" rel="v062001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us. <span class="verse" rel="v062001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" rel="v062001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete. 
<h6>Fellowship with God</h6>
<!-- 001 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. <span class="verse" rel="v062001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie. <span class="verse" rel="v062001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. <span class="verse" rel="v062001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. <span class="verse" rel="v062001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing. <span class="verse" rel="v062001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us. 
<!-- 002 010 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father – Jesus Christ, the righteous. <span class="verse" rel="v062002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world. <span class="verse" rel="v062002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 It is by keeping God’s commands that we can be sure we know him. <span class="verse" rel="v062002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them. <span class="verse" rel="v062002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him: <span class="verse" rel="v062002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did. 
<h6>A new commandment</h6>
<!-- 002 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard. <span class="verse" rel="v062002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. <span class="verse" rel="v062002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness. <span class="verse" rel="v062002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble. <span class="verse" rel="v062002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them. 
<h6>Those who know God should not love the world</h6>
<!-- 002 011 -->


<p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v062002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Little children, I am writing to you 
<p class="indent2">  because your sins have been forgiven for Christ’s sake. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v062002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Parents, I am writing to you 
<p class="indent2">  because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. 
<p class="indent1">  Young people, I am writing to you 
<p class="indent2">  because you have conquered the evil one. 
<p class="indent1">  Children, I write to you 
<p class="indent2">  because you have come to know the Father. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v062002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Parents, I write to you 
<p class="indent2">  because you have learned to know him who has been from the beginning. 
<p class="indent1">  Young people, I write to you 
<p class="indent2">  because you are strong, 
<p class="indent2">  and God’s message is always in your hearts, 
<p class="indent2">  and you have conquered the evil one. 
<!-- 002 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them. <span class="verse" rel="v062002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 For all that the world can offer – the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth – belongs, not to the Father, but to the world. <span class="verse" rel="v062002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remain for ever. 
<h6>Warnings against an antichrist</h6>
<!-- 002 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour. <span class="verse" rel="v062002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us – if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us. <span class="verse" rel="v062002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth. <span class="verse" rel="v062002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth. 
<!-- 002 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist – one who rejects the Father and the Son. <span class="verse" rel="v062002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also. <span class="verse" rel="v062002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father. <span class="verse" rel="v062002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 And this is what he himself promised us – eternal life! 
<!-- 002 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you. <span class="verse" rel="v062002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him. <span class="verse" rel="v062002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn’t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming. <span class="verse" rel="v062002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 Since you know he is righteous, you realize that everyone who does what is right is his child. 
<h6>God’s Children</h6>
<!-- 003 029 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God’s children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him. <span class="verse" rel="v062003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is. <span class="verse" rel="v062003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure. 
<!-- 003 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness. <span class="verse" rel="v062003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him. <span class="verse" rel="v062003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him. <span class="verse" rel="v062003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous. <span class="verse" rel="v062003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared. 
<!-- 003 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children. <span class="verse" rel="v062003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God. <span class="verse" rel="v062003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another. <span class="verse" rel="v062003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous. 
<h6>Love each other</h6>
<!-- 003 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you. <span class="verse" rel="v062003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death. <span class="verse" rel="v062003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them. 
<!-- 003 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 This is how we know what love is: Christ gave his life for us. So we should lay down our own lives for each other. <span class="verse" rel="v062003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them? <span class="verse" rel="v062003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be true and show itself in actions. 
<!-- 003 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God’s presence: <span class="verse" rel="v062003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything. <span class="verse" rel="v062003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence, <span class="verse" rel="v062003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him. <span class="verse" rel="v062003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us. <span class="verse" rel="v062003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he has given us. 
<h6>True and False Inspiration</h6>
<!-- 004 024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
<!-- 004 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit, <span class="verse" rel="v062004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world! 
<!-- 004 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. <span class="verse" rel="v062004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them. <span class="verse" rel="v062004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception. 
<h6>God is love</h6>
<!-- 004 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. <span class="verse" rel="v062004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love. <span class="verse" rel="v062004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. <span class="verse" rel="v062004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
<!-- 004 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v062004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another. <span class="verse" rel="v062004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us. <span class="verse" rel="v062004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit. <span class="verse" rel="v062004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. <span class="verse" rel="v062004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God. <span class="verse" rel="v062004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us. 
<!-- 004 016 -->


<p> God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them. <span class="verse" rel="v062004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ. <span class="verse" rel="v062004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love. <span class="verse" rel="v062004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 We love, because God first loved us. <span class="verse" rel="v062004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. <span class="verse" rel="v062004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other. 
<h6>Faith and Confidence</h6>
<!-- 005 021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child. <span class="verse" rel="v062005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands. <span class="verse" rel="v062005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden, <span class="verse" rel="v062005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith! <span class="verse" rel="v062005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? <span class="verse" rel="v062005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood – not by water only but by water and blood – and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth. <span class="verse" rel="v062005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 Indeed three testify: <span class="verse" rel="v062005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree. <span class="verse" rel="v062005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son. <span class="verse" rel="v062005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son. <span class="verse" rel="v062005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. <span class="verse" rel="v062005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v062005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life. <span class="verse" rel="v062005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us. <span class="verse" rel="v062005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 And if we know he hears us – whatever we ask – we know also that what we ask for is ours. <span class="verse" rel="v062005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. <span class="verse" rel="v062005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.

 We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them. <span class="verse" rel="v062005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 We know that we are God’s children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. <span class="verse" rel="v062005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God – and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. <span class="verse" rel="v062005021" id="005021" >21</span>
 My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.
