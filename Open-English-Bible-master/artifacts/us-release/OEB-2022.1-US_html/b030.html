<h1>Amos</h1>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he message of Amos, one of the sheep breeders of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, and in the reign of Jeroboam the son of King Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake. <span class="verse" rel="v030001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Amos said: 
<p class="indent1">  Whenever the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  roars from Zion, 
<p class="indent1">  and utters his voice from Jerusalem, 
<p class="indent1">  the pastures of the shepherds dry up, 
<p class="indent1">  the top of Carmel becomes arid. 
<h6>God’s Judgment on Israel’s Neighbors</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Damascus’ three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They have threshed Gilead 
<p class="indent1">  with threshing instruments of iron. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Therefore I will send fire on Hazael’s house, 
<p class="indent1">  it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 I will break open the gate of Damascus, 
<p class="indent1">  I will wipe out those who live in the valley of Aven 
<p class="indent1">  and the sceptered ruler of Beth-Eden. 
<p class="indent1">  The people of Aram will go into captivity in Kir, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Gaza’s three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They carried away captive a whole nation, 
<p class="indent1">  sold them as slaves to Edom. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Therefore I will send fire on the wall of Gaza, 
<p class="indent1">  and it shall devour her palaces. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 And I will wipe out those who live in Ashdod, 
<p class="indent1">  and the sceptered ruler of Askelon. 
<p class="indent1">  I will turn my hand against Ekron, 
<p class="indent1">  and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Tyre’s three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They carried away captive a whole people into exile in Edom, 
<p class="indent1">  and did not remember the brotherly covenant. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 So I will send fire on the walls of Tyre. 
<p class="indent1">  It will devour her palaces. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Edom’s three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They pursued their relatives with the sword, 
<p class="indent1">  stilled their pity, 
<p class="indent1">  cherished their anger continually, 
<p class="indent1">  retained their fury forever. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 So I will send a fire into Teman. 
<p class="indent1">  It will destroy the palaces of Bozrah. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Ammonites’ three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, 
<p class="indent1">  in their lust for land. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah. 
<p class="indent1">  It will destroy her palaces, 
<p class="indent1">  with a war-cry in the day of battle, 
<p class="indent1">  with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Their king will go into exile, 
<p class="indent1">  he and his nobles together, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Moab’s three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They have burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 to desecrate the dead. 
<p class="indent1">  So I will send a fire into Moab. 
<p class="indent1">  It will devour the palaces of Kirioth, 
<p class="indent1">  with a war-cry, 
<p class="indent1">  with the sound of trumpets. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 I will kill the ruler, 
<p class="indent1">  all his nobles I will slay with him, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  For Judah’s three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They have rejected the law of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<p class="indent1">  and have not kept his statutes. 
<p class="indent1">  Instead their false gods their ancestors followed, 
<p class="indent1">  have led them astray. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 So I will send a fire on Judah. 
<p class="indent1">  It will devour the palaces of Jerusalem. 
<h6>God’s Judgment on Israel</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: 
<p class="indent1">  For Israel’s three crimes – no, four! – 
<p class="indent1">  I will not rescind my judgment. 
<p class="indent1">  They sell the righteous for money, 
<p class="indent1">  the needy for a pair of shoes. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 They trample on the head of the poor, 
<p class="indent1">  push the humble out of the way. 
<p class="indent1">  Father and son go to the same temple girl, 
<p class="indent1">  and so profane my holy name. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 They stretch themselves 
<p class="indent1">  on garments taken in pledges beside every altar, 
<p class="indent1">  and they drink the wine 
<p class="indent1">  of those who have been fined in the house of their God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 It was I who destroyed the Amorites for your sake, 
<p class="indent1">  whose height was like that of the cedars, 
<p class="indent1">  as strong as oaks. 
<p class="indent1">  I destroyed their fruit from above 
<p class="indent1">  and their roots from below. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt, 
<p class="indent1">  led you forty years in the wilderness, 
<p class="indent1">  brought you here to possess the land of the Amorites. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 I raised up some of your sons to be prophets 
<p class="indent1">  some of your youths to be Nazirites. 
<p class="indent1">  Is not this indeed so, Israelites? 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 But you made the Nazirites drink wine 
<p class="indent1">  and banned the prophets from prophesying. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Listen! 
<p class="indent1">  It is I who will make you groan in your places, 
<p class="indent1">  as a wagon groans under its load of grain. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Then flight will fail the swift, 
<p class="indent1">  and the strength of the strongest will be useless. 
<p class="indent1">  The warrior will not save his life, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 the archer will not stand firm, 
<p class="indent1">  the swift of foot will not escape, 
<p class="indent1">  the horseman will not save his life. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 The bravest of warriors 
<p class="indent1">  will flee away naked in that day, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<h6>A Warning to Israel</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Listen to this message, Israelites, 
<p class="indent1">  which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken against you, 
<p class="indent1">  against the whole nation that I brought out of Egypt: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 You alone have I cared for of all the nations of the world, 
<p class="indent1">  this is why I will punish you for your crimes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Do two walk together 
<p class="indent1">  unless they agreed to meet? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Does a lion roar in the forest 
<p class="indent1">  when there is no prey for him? 
<p class="indent1">  Does a young lion cry out in his den 
<p class="indent1">  unless he has caught something? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Does a bird swoop down into a trap 
<p class="indent1">  if no bait is set for it? 
<p class="indent1">  Does a trap spring up from the ground 
<p class="indent1">  if nothing sets it off? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 Can a trumpet be blown in a city 
<p class="indent1">  and the people not tremble? 
<p class="indent1">  Can disaster strike a city 
<p class="indent1">  and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  not have caused it? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Surely the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  does nothing 
<p class="indent1">  without revealing his purpose to his servants the prophets. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 The lion has roared; who does not fear? 
<p class="indent1">  The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  has spoken; who will not prophesy? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Proclaim over the palaces in Ashdod, 
<p class="indent1">  and over the palaces in the land of Egypt: 
<p class="indent1">  Gather upon the mountain of Samaria, 
<p class="indent1">  and see the violent turmoil, 
<p class="indent1">  the acts of oppression in her midst. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 For they do not know how to do right. 
<p class="indent1">  They are heaping up violence 
<p class="indent1">  and oppression in their palaces, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Therefore the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  An enemy will surround the land, 
<p class="indent1">  he will strip your strength from you. 
<p class="indent1">  and your palaces will be looted. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <p>
<p class="indent1">  Just as a shepherd rescues from the jaws of a lion 
<p class="indent1">  two shinbones or a piece of an ear, 
<p class="indent1">  so the Israelites living in Sameria will be rescued – 
<p class="indent1">  with the corner of a couch, 
<p class="indent1">  and the damask of a divan! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Listen and testify against the house of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  says the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , the God of hosts. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 On the day when I punish Israel for their crimes, 
<p class="indent1">  I will also visit in judgment the altars of Bethel, 
<p class="indent1">  the horns of the altar will be hacked off, 
<p class="indent1">  and they will fall to the ground. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 I will destroy the winter houses 
<p class="indent1">  together with the summer houses 
<p class="indent1">  and the houses of ivory will perish. 
<p class="indent1">  Many great houses will be swept away, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Listen to this message, women of Sameria, 
<p class="indent1">  you well-fed cows of Bashan, 
<p class="indent1">  who oppress the poor and crush the needy, 
<p class="indent1">  who say to your husbands, “Bring us another drink!” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  has sworn by his holiness: 
<p class="indent1">  The time is coming when you will be carried away in baskets, 
<p class="indent1">  your children carried away in fish-baskets, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 and through the breaches in the city wall you will go, 
<p class="indent1">  thrown out on the garbage dump, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Come to Bethel and transgress, 
<p class="indent1">  at Gilgald increase your transgression. 
<p class="indent1">  Bring your sacrifices in the morning, 
<p class="indent1">  every third day your tithes! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering, 
<p class="indent1">  proclaim aloud your voluntary offerings, 
<p class="indent1">  for you love to do this, Israelites! 
<p class="indent1">  says the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> . <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 But it was I who gave to you 
<p class="indent1">  empty stomachs in all your cities, 
<p class="indent1">  and lack of bread in all your towns, 
<p class="indent1">  yet you have not returned to me, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 It was I who withheld from you the rain, 
<p class="indent1">  sending rain on one city, 
<p class="indent1">  while on another I allowed no rain. 
<p class="indent1">  One field received rain, 
<p class="indent1">  while a field without rain withered. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 People from two or three cities 
<p class="indent1">  ranged as far as another city 
<p class="indent1">  for drinking water, 
<p class="indent1">  and still they did not have enough, 
<p class="indent1">  yet you did not return to me, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 I struck you with blight and mildew, 
<p class="indent1">  I laid waste your gardens and vineyards. 
<p class="indent1">  The swarming locust devoured your fig and your olive trees, 
<p class="indent1">  yet you did not return to me, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 I sent plague among you like the plagues of Egypt, 
<p class="indent1">  I slew your youths with the sword, your horses raided away, 
<p class="indent1">  I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils, 
<p class="indent1">  yet you did not return to me, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 I wrought a destruction among you, 
<p class="indent1">  as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. 
<p class="indent1">  You were like a stick snatched from the fire, 
<p class="indent1">  yet you did not return to me, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  and because I am about to do this to you, 
<p class="indent1">  prepare to meet your God, Israel. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 He is here! 
<p class="indent1">  He who forms the mountains, 
<p class="indent1">  creates the wind, 
<p class="indent1">  declares to his thoughts to mortals, 
<p class="indent1">  makes dawn and darkness, 
<p class="indent1">  treads upon the heights of the earth, 
<p class="indent1">  the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of hosts, is his name! 
<h6>A Funeral Song for Israel</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Listen to the words of the funeral song 
<p class="indent1">  I am singing for you, Israel: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel! 
<p class="indent1">  Hurled down upon her own soil she lies, 
<p class="indent1">  with no one to lift her up! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 For the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  says this: 
<p class="indent1">  The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers 
<p class="indent1">  has only a hundred left, 
<p class="indent1">  and the one that marches out with a hundred 
<p class="indent1">  has only ten left. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says this to Israel: 
<p class="indent1">  Seek me and live, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 But do not seek Bethel, 
<p class="indent1">  do not enter Gilgal, 
<p class="indent1">  do not go over to Beer-sheba. 
<p class="indent1">  For Gilgal will enter exile, 
<p class="indent1">  and Bethel will go to destruction. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 Seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and live, 
<p class="indent1">  or he will cast fire on the house of Joseph, 
<p class="indent1">  and it will devour 
<p class="indent1">  and there will be no one to quench it for Bethel. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 You who turn judgment to bitter wormwood, 
<p class="indent1">  and cast righteousness into the dirt: <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 He who made the Pleiades and Orion, 
<p class="indent1">  who turns deep darkness into dawn, 
<p class="indent1">  who darkens day again into night, 
<p class="indent1">  who summons the waters of the sea, 
<p class="indent1">  and pours them out on the earth’s surface, 
<p class="indent1">  the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is his name! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 He causes destruction to burst over the strong. 
<p class="indent1">  He brings devastation on the fortress. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 You who hate the arbiters at the city gate, 
<p class="indent1">  and abhor anyone who speaks the truth: <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 Because you trample on the weak, 
<p class="indent1">  and tax their grain, 
<p class="indent1">  although you have built houses of hewn stone, 
<p class="indent1">  you will not live in them, 
<p class="indent1">  although you have planted charming vineyards, 
<p class="indent1">  you will not drink their wine. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 For I know how many are your crimes, 
<p class="indent1">  and how great are your sins! 
<p class="indent1">  You persecutors of the righteous, takers of bribes! 
<p class="indent1">  You deny the poor their justice at the city gate. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 It would be wise to keep quiet in such an evil time. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 Seek good and not evil, 
<p class="indent1">  that you may live, 
<p class="indent1">  so the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, God of hosts, 
<p class="indent1">  may be with you, as you have claimed he is. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 Hate evil and love good, 
<p class="indent1">  establish justice at the city gate. 
<p class="indent1">  Perhaps the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of hosts, 
<p class="indent1">  will be gracious to a surviving remnant of Joseph. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of hosts, says: 
<p class="indent1">  In all the public squares there will be wailing, 
<p class="indent1">  in every street the sound of mourning. 
<p class="indent1">  They will summon the farmers to mourning, 
<p class="indent1">  and professional mourners to wailing. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 In all vineyards there will be lamenting, 
<p class="indent1">  when I pass through your midst, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 Fools who long for the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>! 
<p class="indent1">  What does the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  mean to you? 
<p class="indent1">  It is darkness, and not light. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 It is as when one flees from a lion, 
<p class="indent1">  and is attacked by a bear, 
<p class="indent1">  as when one reaches home, leans his hand on the wall, 
<p class="indent1">  and a snake bites him. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 Won’t the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s day be darkness and not light, 
<p class="indent1">  murky darkness without a ray of light in it? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005021" id="005021" >21</span>
 I hate, I despise your feasts, 
<p class="indent1">  I will not smell the savor of your festivals, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005022" id="005022" >22</span>
 I will not be pleased with your burnt offerings, 
<p class="indent1">  your grain offerings, 
<p class="indent1">  I will not accept the peace offerings 
<p class="indent1">  of your fattened calves. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005023" id="005023" >23</span>
 Spare me the noise of your songs, 
<p class="indent1">  I will not listen to the melody of your lyres. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005024" id="005024" >24</span>
 But let justice roll on as a flood of waters, 
<p class="indent1">  and righteousness like an unfailing stream. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005025" id="005025" >25</span>
 Was it only sacrifices and grain offerings 
<p class="indent1">  you brought me 
<p class="indent1">  during the forty years in the wilderness, Israel? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005026" id="005026" >26</span>
 But now you will lift up your "king" Sikkuth 
<p class="indent1">  and "star god" Kiyyun, 
<p class="indent1">  your idols which you have made for yourselves, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030005027" id="005027" >27</span>
 as I drive you into exile beyond Damascus, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, whose name is the God of hosts. <p>
<h6>The Destruction of Israel</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> Sorrow awaits who are carefree in Zion, 
<p class="indent1">  overconfident on the mountain of Samaria! 
<p class="indent1">  The elite of this, the best of nations, 
<p class="indent1">  on whom the people of Israel rest their hopes! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 You say to the people: 
<p class="indent1">  Cross over to Calneh and see, 
<p class="indent1">  go from there to Hamath the great, 
<p class="indent1">  then go down to Gath of the Philistines: 
<p class="indent1">  Are they better than these kingdoms? 
<p class="indent1">  Is their territory larger than yours? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 You push away all thoughts of the evil day, 
<p class="indent1">  yet have instituted a rule of violence. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 They lie on ivory couches, 
<p class="indent1">  sprawl on their divans, 
<p class="indent1">  eat choice lambs from the flock, 
<p class="indent1">  and fattened calves from the stall. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 They idly sing to the sound of the lyre, 
<p class="indent1">  thinking themselves songwriters like David, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 they drink bowlfuls of wine, 
<p class="indent1">  and anoint themselves with the finest of oil. 
<p class="indent1">  But they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 Therefore now they must go into exile 
<p class="indent1">  at the head of the captives, 
<p class="indent1">  and hushed will be the revelry of the sprawlers. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , 
<p class="indent1">  the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of hosts, has sworn by himself: 
<p class="indent1">  I abhor the pride of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  I hate his palaces,

 If ten people remain in one house, then they will die. <span class="verse" rel="v030006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 When the uncle and another member of the family of a dead man come to carry the body out of the house for burial, they will call to someone in a corner of the house, ‘Any more there?’ and he will answer, ‘No’, and then he will add, ‘Be quiet!’ – for the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  must not be mentioned. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 Look! The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is giving the command!

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 Do horses gallop on crags? 
<p class="indent1">  Does one plow the sea with oxen? 
<p class="indent1">  Yet you turn justice into poison weed,

 You who are so proud 
<p class="indent1">  of capturing Lo-debar, 
<p class="indent1">  who say, ‘Have we not by our own strength

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 I am now raising up against you,

<h6>A Vision of Locusts</h6>
<!-- 007 014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> This is what the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  showed me: he was forming a swarm of locusts, when the late spring grass began to come up after the king’s share had been harvested. <span class="verse" rel="v030007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 And when they had finished devouring all the land’s vegetation, I said: 
<p class="indent1">  “Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , forgive, I beg you! 
<p class="indent1">  How can Jacob survive, 
<p class="indent1">  for he is so helpless?” 
<!-- 007 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  relented. This will not happen,” said the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<h6>A Vision of Fire</h6>
<!-- 007 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007004" id="007004" >4</span>
  This is what he showed me: the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  was giving command to execute judgment by fire. It burned up the great deep, and had begun to devour the fields, and I said: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 “Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , forgive, I beg you! 
<p class="indent1">  How can Jacob survive, 
<p class="indent1">  for he is so helpless?” 
<!-- 007 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007006" id="007006" >6</span>
  The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  relented. “This will not happen either,” said the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<h6>A Vision of a Plumb Line</h6>
<!-- 007 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007007" id="007007" >7</span>
  This is what the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. <span class="verse" rel="v030007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me, 
<p class="indent1">  “What do you see, Amos?” 
<!-- 007 008 -->


<p>  And I answered, 
<p class="indent1">  “A plumb line,” 
<!-- 007 008 -->


<p>  Then the Lord said, 
<p class="indent1">  “Watch: I am setting a plumb line 
<p class="indent1">  in the midst of my people Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  I will no longer overlook their crookedness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 And the high places of Isaac 
<p class="indent1">  will be desolate, 
<p class="indent1">  the sanctuaries of Israel 
<p class="indent1">  will be laid waste, 
<p class="indent1">  and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam 
<p class="indent1">  with the sword.” 
<h6>Amaziah and Amos</h6>
<!-- 007 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 Then Amaziah, chief priest of Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: “Amos has conspired against you right in the heart of Israel. The country cannot survive all his words. <span class="verse" rel="v030007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will be led away captive out of their land.’” 
<!-- 007 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 And Amaziah said to Amos, “Leave, you who see visions, go to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and prophesy there, <span class="verse" rel="v030007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 but don’t prophesy any more at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the royal residence.” 
<!-- 007 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v030007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 “I am no prophet,” Amos answered Amaziah, “nor trained as one.  I am a shepherd and a keeper of sycamores fig trees. <span class="verse" rel="v030007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  took me away from following the flock, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ <span class="verse" rel="v030007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 Now therefore listen to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message: 
<p class="indent1">  ‘You say not to prophesy against Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  nor to preach against the house of Isaac. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: 
<p class="indent1">  Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, 
<p class="indent1">  your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, 
<p class="indent1">  your land will be divided up, 
<p class="indent1">  you will die on unclean soil, 
<p class="indent1">  and Israel will be led away captive out of their land.’” 
<h6>The Time is Ripe</h6>
<!-- 008 017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  showed me this: a basket of summer fruit. <span class="verse" rel="v030008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 “What do you see, Amos?” he asked. I replied, “A basket of ripe summer fruit.” Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me: 
<p class="indent1">  The time is ripe for my people Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  I will no longer overlook their crimes. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 The singing women in the palace will howl on that day, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent1">  Corpses everywhere, 
<p class="indent1">  thrown out in silence. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 Listen to this, you who trample on the needy, 
<p class="indent1">  who oppress the poor of the earth, <span class="verse" rel="v030008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 saying: 
<p class="indent1">  When will the feast of the new moon be over 
<p class="indent1">  so that we may sell grain? 
<p class="indent1">  And the sabbath ended 
<p class="indent1">  so that we may offer wheat for sale? 
<p class="indent1">  Reducing the measure and increasing the price, 
<p class="indent1">  cheating with false scales, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 mixing the sweepings in with the wheat. 
<p class="indent1">  Then we can buy the poor for money, 
<p class="indent1">  the needy for a pair of shoes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 Now the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has taken an oath 
<p class="indent1">  by the Pride of Jacob: 
<p class="indent1">  I will never forget all their deeds! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 Because of this won’t the land quake, 
<p class="indent1">  and all its inhabitants mourn? 
<p class="indent1">  Won’t the whole of it rise like the Nile, 
<p class="indent1">  churn and subside like the Nile in Egypt? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 On that day, says the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , 
<p class="indent1">  I will make the sun set at noon 
<p class="indent1">  and darken the earth in broad daylight. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 I will turn your feasts into mourning, 
<p class="indent1">  all your songs into dirges. 
<p class="indent1">  I will cause you to dress in sackcloth, 
<p class="indent1">  every head shaved. 
<p class="indent1">  I will make you mourn like you have lost your only son, 
<p class="indent1">  all that happens will end in bitterness. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 The day is coming, says the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , 
<p class="indent1">  when I will send hunger in the land. 
<p class="indent1">  Not a famine of bread or thirst for water, 
<p class="indent1">  but for hearing the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 Then they will wander from sea to sea, 
<p class="indent1">  from the north to the east, 
<p class="indent1">  to seek a message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  but they will not find it. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 In that day beautiful girls and strong young men 
<p class="indent1">  will faint from thirst. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 Those who take oaths by the shameful idol of Samaria, 
<p class="indent1">  who swear, ‘As surely as your God lives, O Dan!’ 
<p class="indent1">  and, ‘By the sacred way to Beer-sheba!’ – 
<p class="indent1">  they will fall and never rise again.

<p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span>  I saw the Lord towering above the altar, and he commanded: 
<p class="indent1">  Strike the tops of the pillars 
<p class="indent1">  so that the foundations may shake, 
<p class="indent1">  bring them down on the heads of the people below. 
<p class="indent1">  The rest of them I will slay with the sword: 
<p class="indent1">  no one will get away, 
<p class="indent1">  no one will escape. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 If they dig down to Sheol, 
<p class="indent1">  there will my hand take them. 
<p class="indent1">  If they climb up to the heavens, 
<p class="indent1">  from there will I bring them down. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, 
<p class="indent1">  there will I search them out and take them. 
<p class="indent1">  If they hide out of my sight at the bottom of the sea, 
<p class="indent1">  there will I command the sea serpent to bite them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 If they are taken into captivity by their enemies, 
<p class="indent1">  there will I command the sword to slay them. 
<p class="indent1">  I will keep my eye on them 
<p class="indent1">  but for evil and not for good. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 It is the Lord the  <span class="nd"> God </span>  of hosts, 
<p class="indent1">  who touches the earth and it trembles, 
<p class="indent1">  all who live on it mourn. 
<p class="indent1">  The earth rises up like the Nile, 
<p class="indent1">  and sinks like the Nile of Egypt. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 The one who builds in the heavens, 
<p class="indent1">  who sets the dome of the sky over the earth, 
<p class="indent1">  who summons the waters of the sea 
<p class="indent1">  and pours them out on the face of the earth: 
<p class="indent1">  the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is his name. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 To me, Israelites, you are 
<p class="indent1">  just like the Cushites, 
<p class="indent1">  says the   <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1">  Yes, I brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, 
<p class="indent1">  but also the Philistines from Caphtor, 
<p class="indent1">  and the Arameans from Kir! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 Behold the eyes of the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>
<p class="indent1">  are on the sinful kingdom: 
<p class="indent1">  I will destroy it from the face of the earth! 
<p class="indent1">  But I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 For behold I am about to give the command, 
<p class="indent1">  and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations 
<p class="indent1">  just as one shakes grain in a sieve, 
<p class="indent1">  but not a pebble shall fall to the ground. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 All the sinners of my people, 
<p class="indent1">  who deny that disaster will touch or befall them, 
<p class="indent1">  will die by the sword. 
<h6>A Promise of Restoration</h6><p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 On that day I will raise up the fallen house of David, 
<p class="indent1">  I will wall up its gaps and raise up its ruins, 
<p class="indent1">  I will rebuild it as it was long ago. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 They will possess again the rest of Edom, 
<p class="indent1">  and all the nations which once you ruled for me, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, who will do this. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 Listen! The days are coming, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  when the harvest is too big to reap 
<p class="indent1">  before it is time to plow, 
<p class="indent1">  when the grapes cannot be all trod 
<p class="indent1">  before it is time to sow, 
<p class="indent1">  when the mountains will run with sweet wine, 
<p class="indent1">  and every hill will flow with it. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 I will bring back my people Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  they will rebuild waste cities and inhabit them, 
<p class="indent1">  plant vineyards and drink their wine, 
<p class="indent1">  make gardens and eat their fruit. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v030009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 I will plant them on their own soil, 
<p class="indent1">  and they will never again be uprooted from their land 
<p class="indent1">  which I have given them, 
<p class="indent1">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God.
